Fabric (http://www.fabfile.org) is a great toolkit for automation and is much more than just ssh on steroids.

Normally you develop scripts which are invoked by calling "fab <task> -H <hostname>" but occassionally it is nice to be able to wrap the whole thing in a single script and in essence hide the fabric from the user.

<code>
from fabric.main import main
from fabric.api import task

@task()
def dostuff():
    stuff


if __name__=="__main__":
    sys.argv = ["fab","-f", __file__, 'dostuff", '-H', sys.argv[1]]
    main()
</code>

Alternatively
<code>
if __name__ == '__main__':
    from fabric.main import main as fabric_main
    fabric_main(fabfile_locations=[__file__])
</code>
