== Randomize kickoff time ==
To stop a lot of cron jobs on multiple machines starting off at the same time put something like this in each of the cron lines

```
 minute => fqdn_rand(59, $::fqdn),
```

If you have many jobs on the same server that you need to spread then try:

```
 minute => fqdn_rand(59, "$::fqdn $::name")
```

This will spread the load if each server is hitting the same source, or is hosted on the same infrastructure (e.g. esx server)
